  <h3>Rules</h3>

  <h4>Setup:</h4>
  <p>
  Set up the game board, Devastation markers, and initial MOD deployment as usual. Remove the Colony
  Influence cards from the Command decks; you may, if desired, replace them with suitable alternatives (such as
  False Intentions for the Diplomat deck). Once all initial MODs are on the board, each player takes the Land
  Territory card from the deck corresponding to the territory in which he or she wants the Capital placed. When
  all players have taken a card, turn them face-up and place a Capital of your color on that territory. Shuffle those
  cards back into the deck afterwards.
  </p>

  <h4>Gameplay:</h4>
  <p>
    In addition to typical Risk 2210 gameplay, add the following rules:
    <ul>
      <li>Capitals, and the territories they occupy, are immune to all negative Command Card effects. If you are playing with the Frontline Amoebas, they are not able to either invade or devastate capitals and should choose a different target.</li>
      <li>If your Capital is captured by another player, you are not out of the game.</li>
      <li>Any player with two capitals suffers no detriment for losing one of them.</li>
      <li>No player may build a Space Station in the same territory as a Capital.</li>
      <li>If you control your own Capital, you may hire a Homefront Commander for 3 Energy, who may be played in one of two ways, depending on player preference:
        <ol>
          <li>The Homefront Commander may not move away from your Capital, but allows all units in that territory to roll 8-sided dice on defense. In addition, if you have two Capitals and control both of them, you may Fortify Move both him and other MODs from one to the other as though they were connected. Also, any effect which relocates the Capital he is stationed in also relocates him.</li>
          <li>The Homefront Commander is as mobile as any other Commander, and defends with a d8. If he is attacking a territory within 2 territories of your Capital, he may roll an 8-sided die; otherwise he rolls a 6-sided die.</li>
        </ol>
        ** In both cases, the Homefront Commander must be placed upon your Capital when he is first hired, and if you lose your Capital, the Homefront Commander is lost as well.
      </li>
      <li>If a player does not control his own Capital at the start of his turn, he may not collect his 3-Territory Bonus on that turn.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h4>Winning the Game:</h4>
  <p>
  The game is no longer on a 5-turn time limit. Instead, the first player to control a set
  number of enemy Capitals, as well as his own, wins the game. That number is: 3 or 4 players, 2 capitals. 5
  players, 3 capitals. (With 6 players, take 4 enemy Capitals, but since 2210 is by itself a 5-player game, outside
  sources must be tapped for this to be possible.) As an alternative, capturing all Capitals may be a valid victory
  condition -- decide which condition to go for before play begins.
